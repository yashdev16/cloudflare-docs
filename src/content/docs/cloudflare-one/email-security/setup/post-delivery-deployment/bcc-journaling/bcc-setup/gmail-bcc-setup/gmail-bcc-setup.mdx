For customers using Gmail as their email provider, setting up Email Security is quick and easy. 

You will need to [enable Gmail BCC on the Zero Trust dashboard](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/bcc-journaling/bcc-setup/gmail-bcc-setup/enable-gmail-integration/), [create an integration](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/bcc-journaling/bcc-setup/gmail-bcc-setup/enable-gmail-integration/), and [connect your domain(s)](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/bcc-journaling/bcc-setup/gmail-bcc-setup/connect-domains/). You can choose to [add additional domains](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/bcc-journaling/bcc-setup/gmail-bcc-setup/connect-domains/) at a later stage.

Once you set up Gmail BCC integration, Email Security will receive a copy of your email messages. The following email flow shows how this works:
