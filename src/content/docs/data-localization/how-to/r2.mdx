In the following sections, we will give you some details about how to configure R2 with Regional Services and Customer Metadata Boundary.

## Regional Services

To configure Regional Services for hostnames [proxied](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/) through Cloudflare and ensure that processing of requesting objects from a [R2 Bucket](/r2/buckets/) occurs only in-region, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select an account.
2. Go to the **R2** tab.
3. Follow the steps to [create a Bucket](/r2/buckets/create-buckets/).
4. [Connect a bucket to a custom domain](/r2/buckets/public-buckets/#connect-a-bucket-to-a-custom-domain).
5. Run the [API POST](/data-localization/regional-services/get-started/#configure-regional-services-via-api) command on the configured bucket custom domain to create a `regional_hostnames` with a specific region.

Regional Services only applies to the custom domain configured for an R2 Bucket.

### Send logs to an EU R2 bucket via an S3-compatible endpoint

The following instructions will show you how to set up a Logpush job using an S3-compatible endpoint to store logs in an R2 bucket with EU jurisdiction.

1. Create an [R2 bucket](/r2/get-started/) in your Cloudflare account and set EU as the jurisdiction.

2. Generate an API token for your R2 bucket. You have the following two options:

<Details header="Generate a token for a specific bucket (recommended)">

Go to the R2 section of your Cloudflare dashboard and select **Manage R2 API Tokens** to generate a token directly tied to your specific bucket. You can follow the instructions in the [Authentication](/r2/api/s3/tokens/) section. 

</Details>

<Details header="Generate a token for all buckets">

You can generate a API token in **Manage Account** > **Account API Tokens** or you can create a user-specific token:

1. Go to **My Profile** > **API Tokens** 
2. Select **Create Token** > **Create Custom Token**
3. Choose **Account** > **Workers R2 Storage** > **Edit** to set permissions.
4. To test your token, copy the `curl` command and paste it into a terminal.

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/user/tokens/verify" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>"
```

The result:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "id": "325xxxxcd",
    "status": "active"
  },
  "success": true,
  "errors": [],
  "messages": [
    {
      "code": 10000,
      "message": "This API Token is valid and active",
      "type": null
    }
  ]
}
```

5. Generate a SHA-256 hash of the token:
      
```bash
echo -n "<token>" | shasum -a 256
```

This command will output a hash similar to `dxxxx391b`. 

</Details>

3. Set up a Logpush destination using [S3-compatible endpoint](/logs/get-started/enable-destinations/s3-compatible-endpoints/) and fill in the required fields as follows:

- **Bucket**: Enter the name of the R2 bucket you created with the EU jurisdiction.
- **Path** (optional): If you want, you can specify a folder path to organize your logs.
- **Endpoint URL**: Provide the S3 API endpoint for your bucket in the format `<account-id>.eu.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`. Do not include the bucket name, as it was set in the first field.
- **Bucket Region**: Use `WEUR` to specify the EU region.
- **Access Key ID**: Enter the Token ID created previously (`325xxxxcd`).
- **Secret Access Key**: Use the SHA-256 hash of the token (`dxxxx391b`).

Complete the configuration by selecting the fields you want to push to your R2 bucket.

## Customer Metadata Boundary

With Customer Metadata Boundary set to `EU`, **R2** > **Bucket** > [**Metrics**](/r2/platform/metrics-analytics/) tab in the account dashboard will be populated.

:::note


Additionally, customers can create R2 buckets with [jurisdictional restrictions set to EU](/r2/reference/data-location/#jurisdictional-restrictions). In this case, we recommend [using jurisdictions with the S3 API](/r2/reference/data-location/#using-jurisdictions-with-the-s3-api).
