4. In **Email messages to affect**, select **Inbound**.

    1. Select **Modify message**.

    4. Under **Envelope recipient**, select **Change envelope recipient** > **Replace recipient** > Enter the email of the recipient.

    6. Under **Headers**, select **Add X-Gm-Spam and X-Gm-Phishy headers**.
    7. Select **SAVE**.
