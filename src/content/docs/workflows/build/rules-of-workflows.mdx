A Workflow contains one or more steps. Each step is a self-contained, individually retriable component of a Workflow. Steps may emit (optional) state that allows a Workflow to persist and continue from that step, even if a Workflow fails due to a network or infrastructure issue.

This is a small guidebook on how to build more resilient and correct Workflows.

### Ensure API/Binding calls are idempotent

Because a step might be retried multiple times, your steps should (ideally) be idempotent. For context, idempotency is a logical property where the operation (in this case a step),
can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.

As an example, let us assume you have a Workflow that charges your customers, and you really do not want to charge them twice by accident. Before charging them, you should
check if they were already charged:

<TypeScriptExample filename="index.ts">
```ts
export class MyWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint {
	async run(event: WorkflowEvent<Params>, step: WorkflowStep) {
		const customer_id = 123456;
		// ✅ Good: Non-idempotent API/Binding calls are always done **after** checking if the operation is
		// still needed.
		await step.do(
			`charge ${customer_id} for its monthly subscription`,
			async () => {
				// API call to check if customer was already charged
				const subscription = await fetch(
					`https://payment.processor/subscriptions/${customer_id}`,
				).then((res) => res.json());

				// return early if the customer was already charged, this can happen if the destination service dies
				// in the middle of the request but still commits it, or if the Workflows Engine restarts.
				if (subscription.charged) {
					return;
				}

				// non-idempotent call, this operation can fail and retry but still commit in the payment
				// processor - which means that, on retry, it would mischarge the customer again if the above checks
				// were not in place.
				return await fetch(
					`https://payment.processor/subscriptions/${customer_id}`,
					{
						method: "POST",
						body: JSON.stringify({ amount: 10.0 }),
					},
				);
			},
		);
	}
}
```
</TypeScriptExample>

:::note

Guaranteeing idempotency might be optional in your specific use-case and implementation, but we recommend that you always try to guarantee it.

### Make your steps granular

Steps should be as self-contained as possible. This allows your own logic to be more durable in case of failures in third-party APIs, network errors, and so on.

You can also think of it as a transaction, or a unit of work.

- ✅ Minimize the number of API/binding calls per step (unless you need multiple calls to prove idempotency).

<TypeScriptExample filename="index.ts">
```ts
export class MyWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint {
	async run(event: WorkflowEvent<Params>, step: WorkflowStep) {
		// ✅ Good: Unrelated API/Binding calls are self-contained, so that in case one of them fails
		// it can retry them individually. It also has an extra advantage: you can control retry or
		// timeout policies for each granular step - you might not to want to overload http.cat in
		// case of it being down.
		const httpCat = await step.do("get cutest cat from KV", async () => {
			return await env.KV.get("cutest-http-cat");
		});

		const image = await step.do("fetch cat image from http.cat", async () => {
			return await fetch(`https://http.cat/${httpCat}`);
		});
	}
}
```
</TypeScriptExample>

Otherwise, your entire Workflow might not be as durable as you might think, and you may encounter some undefined behaviour. You can avoid them by following the rules below:

- 🔴 Do not encapsulate your entire logic in one single step.
- 🔴 Do not call separate services in the same step (unless you need it to prove idempotency).
- 🔴 Do not make too many service calls in the same step (unless you need it to prove idempotency).
- 🔴 Do not do too much CPU-intensive work inside a single step - sometimes the engine may have to restart, and it will start over from the beginning of that step.

<TypeScriptExample filename="index.ts">
```ts
export class MyWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint {
	async run(event: WorkflowEvent<Params>, step: WorkflowStep) {
		// 🔴 Bad: you're calling two seperate services from within the same step. This might cause
		// some extra calls to the first service in case the second one fails, and in some cases, makes
		// the step non-idempotent altogether
		const image = await step.do("get cutest cat from KV", async () => {
			const httpCat = await env.KV.get("cutest-http-cat");
			return fetch(`https://http.cat/${httpCat}`);
		});
	}
}
```
</TypeScriptExample>

### Do not rely on state outside of a step

Workflows may hibernate and lose all in-memory state. This will happen when engine detects that there is no pending work and can hibernate until it needs to wake-up (because of a sleep, retry, or event).

This means that you should not store state outside of a step:

<TypeScriptExample filename="index.ts">
```ts
function getRandomInt(min, max) {
	const minCeiled = Math.ceil(min);
	const maxFloored = Math.floor(max);
	return Math.floor(Math.random() * (maxFloored - minCeiled) + minCeiled); // The maximum is exclusive and the minimum is inclusive
}

export class MyWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint {
	async run(event: WorkflowEvent<Params>, step: WorkflowStep) {
		// 🔴 Bad: `imageList` will be not persisted across engine's lifetimes. Which means that after hibernation,
		// `imageList` will be empty again, even though the following two steps have already ran.
		const imageList: string[] = [];

		await step.do("get first cutest cat from KV", async () => {
			const httpCat = await env.KV.get("cutest-http-cat-1");

			imageList.append(httpCat);
		});

		await step.do("get second cutest cat from KV", async () => {
			const httpCat = await env.KV.get("cutest-http-cat-2");

			imageList.append(httpCat);
		});

		// A long sleep can (and probably will) hibernate the engine which means that the first engine lifetime ends here
		await step.sleep("💤💤💤💤", "3 hours");

		// When this runs, it will be on the second engine lifetime - which means `imageList` will be empty.
		await step.do(
			"choose a random cat from the list and download it",
			async () => {
				const randomCat = imageList.at(getRandomInt(0, imageList.length));
				// this will fail since `randomCat` is undefined because `imageList` is empty
				return await fetch(`https://http.cat/${randomCat}`);
			},
		);
	}
}
```
</TypeScriptExample>

Instead, you should build top-level state exclusively comprised of `step.do` returns:

<TypeScriptExample filename="index.ts">
```ts
function getRandomInt(min, max) {
	const minCeiled = Math.ceil(min);
	const maxFloored = Math.floor(max);
	return Math.floor(Math.random() * (maxFloored - minCeiled) + minCeiled); // The maximum is exclusive and the minimum is inclusive
}

export class MyWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint {
	async run(event: WorkflowEvent<Params>, step: WorkflowStep) {
		// ✅ Good: imageList state is exclusively comprised of step returns - this means that in the event of
		// multiple engine lifetimes, imageList will be built accordingly
		const imageList: string[] = await Promise.all([
			step.do("get first cutest cat from KV", async () => {
				return await env.KV.get("cutest-http-cat-1");
			}),

			step.do("get second cutest cat from KV", async () => {
				return await env.KV.get("cutest-http-cat-2");
			}),
		]);

		// A long sleep can (and probably will) hibernate the engine which means that the first engine lifetime ends here
		await step.sleep("💤💤💤💤", "3 hours");

		// When this runs, it will be on the second engine lifetime - but this time, imageList will contain
		// the two most cutest cats
		await step.do(
			"choose a random cat from the list and download it",
			async () => {
				const randomCat = imageList.at(getRandomInt(0, imageList.length));
				// this will eventually succeed since `randomCat` is defined
				return await fetch(`https://http.cat/${randomCat}`);
			},
		);
	}
}
```
</TypeScriptExample>

### Do not mutate your incoming events

The `event` passed to your Workflow's `run` method is immutable: changes you make to the event are not persisted across steps and/or Workflow restarts.

<TypeScriptExample filename="index.ts">
```ts
interface MyEvent {
  user: string;
  data: string;
}

export class MyWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint {
	async run(event: WorkflowEvent<MyEvent>, step: WorkflowStep) {
		// 🔴 Bad: Mutating the event
		// This will not be persisted across steps and `event.data` will
		// take on its original value.
		await step.do("bad step that mutates the incoming event", async () => {
		    let userData = await env.KV.get(event.user)
				event.data = userData
		})

		// ✅ Good: persist data by returning it as state from your step
		// Use that state in subsequent steps
		let userData = await step.do("good step that returns state", async () => {
		  return await env.KV.get(event.user)
		})

		let someOtherData = await step.do("following step that uses that state", async () => {
		  // Access to userData here
			// Will always be the same if this step is retried
		})
	}
}
```
</TypeScriptExample>

### Name steps deterministically

Steps should be named deterministically (ie, not using the current date/time, randomness, etc). This  ensures that their state is cached, and prevents the step from being rerun unnecessarily. Step names act as the "cache key" in your Workflow.

<TypeScriptExample filename="index.ts">
```ts
export class MyWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint {
	async run(event: WorkflowEvent<Params>, step: WorkflowStep) {
		// 🔴 Bad: Naming the step non-deterministically prevents it from being cached
		// This will cause the step to be re-run if subsequent steps fail.
		await step.do(`step #1 running at: ${Date.now()}`, async () => {
		    let userData = await env.KV.get(event.user)
				event.data = userData
		})

		// ✅ Good: give steps a deterministic name.
		// Return dynamic values in your state, or log them instead.
		let state = await step.do("fetch user data from KV", async () => {
		    let userData = await env.KV.get(event.user)
				console.log(`fetched at ${Date.now}`)
				return userData
		})

		// ✅ Good: steps that are dynamically named are constructed in a deterministic way.
		// In this case, `catList` is a step output, which is stable, and `catList` is
		// traversed in a deterministic fashion (no shuffles or random accesses) so,
		// it's fine to dynamically name steps (e.g: create a step per list entry).
		let catList = await step.do("get cat list from KV", async () => {
			return await env.KV.get("cat-list")
		})

		for(const cat of catList) {
			await step.do(`get cat: ${cat}`, async () => {
				return await env.KV.get(cat)
			})
		}
	}
}
```
</TypeScriptExample>

### Instance IDs are unique

Workflow [instance IDs](/workflows/build/workers-api/#workflowinstance) are unique per Workflow. The ID is the unique identifier that associates logs, metrics, state and status of a run to a specific an instance, even after completion. Allowing ID re-use would make it hard to understand if a Workflow instance ID referred to an instance that run yesterday, last week or today.

It would also present a problem if you wanted to run multiple different Workflow instances with different [input parameters](/workflows/build/events-and-parameters/) for the same user ID, as you would immediately need to determine a new ID mapping.

If you need to associate multiple instances with a specific user, merchant or other "customer" ID in your system, consider using a composite ID or using randomly generated IDs and storing the mapping in a database like [D1](/d1/).

<TypeScriptExample filename="index.ts">
```ts
// This is in the same file as your Workflow definition
export default {
  async fetch(req: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
		// 🔴 Bad: Use an ID that isn't unique across future Workflow invocations
		let userId = getUserId(req) // Returns the userId
    let badInstance = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.create({
    	id: userId,
    	params: payload
    });

    // ✅ Good: use an ID that is unique
    // e.g. a transaction ID, order ID, or task ID are good options
    let instanceId = getTransactionId() // e.g. assuming transaction IDs are unique
    // or: compose a composite ID and store it in your database
    // so that you can track all instances associated with a specific user or merchant.
    instanceId = `${getUserId(request)}-${await crypto.randomUUID().slice(0, 6)}`
    let { result } = await addNewInstanceToDB(userId, instanceId)
    let goodInstance = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.create({
    	id: userId,
    	params: payload
    });

    return Response.json({
      id: goodInstance.id,
      details: await goodInstance.status(),
    });
  },
};
```
