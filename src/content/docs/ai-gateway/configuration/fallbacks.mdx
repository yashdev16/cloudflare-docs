Specify model or provider fallback with your [Universal endpoint](/ai-gateway/providers/universal/) to specify what to do if a request fails.

## Example

For example, you could set up a gateway endpoint that:

1. Sends a request to Workers AI Inference API.
2. If that request fails, proceeds to OpenAI.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[AI Gateway] --> B[Request to Workers AI Inference API]
    B -->|Success| C[Return Response]
    B -->|Failure| D[Request to OpenAI API]
    D --> E[Return Response]
```

<br />

You can add as many fallbacks as you need, just by adding another object in the array.

<Render file="universal-gateway-example" />

## Response header(cf-aig-step)

When using the [Universal endpoint](/ai-gateway/providers/universal/) with fallbacks, the response header `cf-aig-step` indicates which model successfully processed the request by returning the step number. This header provides visibility into whether a fallback was triggered and which model ultimately processed the response.

- `cf-aig-step:0` – The first (primary) model was used successfully.
- `cf-aig-step:1` – The request fell back to the second model.
- `cf-aig-step:2` – The request fell back to the third model.
- Subsequent steps – Each fallback increments the step number by 1.
