<sup>1</sup> If you have reached 10 million logs stored per gateway, new logs
will stop being saved. To continue saving logs, you must delete older logs in
that gateway to free up space or create a new gateway. Refer to [Auto Log
Cleanup](/ai-gateway/observability/logging/#auto-log-cleanup) for more details
on how to automatically delete logs.

<sup>2</sup> If you have reached 100,000 logs stored per account, across all
gateways, new logs will stop being saved. To continue saving logs, you must
delete older logs. Refer to [Auto Log
Cleanup](/ai-gateway/observability/logging/#auto-log-cleanup) for more details
on how to automatically delete logs.

<sup>3</sup> Logs larger than 10 MB will not be stored.
