title: Upload via batch API
---

The Images batch API lets you make several requests in sequence while bypassing Cloudflareâ€™s global API rate limits.

To use the Images batch API, you will need to obtain a batch token and use the token to make several requests. The requests authorized by this batch token are made to a separate endpoint and do not count toward the global API rate limits. Each token is subject to a rate limit of 200 requests per second. You can use multiple tokens if you require higher throughput to the Cloudflare Images API.

To obtain a token, you can use the new `images/v1/batch_token` endpoint as shown in the example below.

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/images/v1/batch_token" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>"

# Response:
{
  "result": {
    "token": "<BATCH_TOKEN>",
    "expiresAt": "2023-08-09T15:33:56.273411222Z"
  },
  "success": true,
  "errors": [],
  "messages": []
}
```

After getting your token, use it to make requests for:

- [Upload an image](/api/resources/images/subresources/v1/methods/create/) - `POST /images/v1`
- [Delete an image](/api/resources/images/subresources/v1/methods/delete/) - `DELETE /images/v1/{identifier}`
- [Image details](/api/resources/images/subresources/v1/methods/get/) - `GET /images/v1/{identifier}`
- [Update image](/api/resources/images/subresources/v1/methods/edit/) - `PATCH /images/v1/{identifier}`
- [List images V2](/api/resources/images/subresources/v2/methods/list/) - `GET /images/v2`
- [Direct upload V2](/api/resources/images/subresources/v2/subresources/direct_uploads/methods/create/) - `POST /images/v2/direct_upload`

These options use a different host and a different path with the same method, request, and response bodies.

```bash title="Request for list images V2 against api.cloudflare.com"
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/images/v2" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>"
```

```bash title="Example request using a batch token"
curl "https://batch.imagedelivery.net/images/v1" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <BATCH_TOKEN>"
```
