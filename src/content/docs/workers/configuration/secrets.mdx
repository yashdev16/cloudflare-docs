## Background

Secrets are a type of binding that allow you to attach encrypted text values to your Worker. You cannot see secrets after you set them and can only access secrets via [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/commands/#secret) or programmatically via the [`env` parameter](/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/fetch/#parameters). Secrets are used for storing sensitive information like API keys and auth tokens. Secrets are available on the [`env` parameter](/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/fetch/#parameters) passed to your Worker's [`fetch` event handler](/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/fetch/).

### Adding secrets to your project

#### Via Wrangler

Secrets can be added through [`wrangler secret put`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#secret) or [`wrangler versions secret put`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#secret-put) commands.

`wrangler secret put` creates a new version of the Worker and deploys it immediately.

```sh
npx wrangler secret put <KEY>
```

If using [gradual deployments](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/gradual-deployments/), instead use the `wrangler versions secret put` command. This will only create a new version of the Worker, that can then be deploying using [`wrangler versions deploy`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#deploy-2).

:::note
Wrangler versions before 3.73.0 require you to specify a `--x-versions` flag.
:::

```sh
npx wrangler versions secret put <KEY>
```

#### Via the dashboard

To add a secret via the dashboard:

1. Log in to [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.
2. Select **Workers & Pages**.
3. In **Overview**, select your Worker > **Settings**.
4. Under **Variables and Secrets**, select **Add**.
5. Select the type **Secret**, input a **Variable name**, and input its **Value**. This secret will be made available to your Worker but the value will be hidden in Wrangler and the dashboard.
6. (Optional) To add more secrets, select **Add variable**.
7. Select **Deploy** to implement your changes.

### Delete secrets from your project

#### Via Wrangler

Secrets can be deleted through [`wrangler secret delete`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#delete-7) or [`wrangler versions secret delete`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#secret-delete) commands.

`wrangler secret delete` creates a new version of the Worker and deploys it immediately.

```sh
npx wrangler secret delete <KEY>
```

If using [gradual deployments](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/gradual-deployments/), instead use the `wrangler versions secret delete` command. This will only create a new version of the Worker, that can then be deploying using [`wrangler versions deploy`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#deploy-2).

```sh
npx wrangler versions secret delete <KEY>
```

#### Via the dashboard

To delete a secret from your Worker project via the dashboard:

1. Log in to [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.
2. Select **Workers & Pages**.
3. In **Overview**, select your Worker > **Settings**.
4. Under **Variables and Secrets**, select **Edit**.
5. In the **Edit** drawer, select **X** next to the secret you want to delete.
6. Select **Deploy** to implement your changes.
7. (Optional) Instead of using the edit drawer, you can click the delete icon next to the secret.
