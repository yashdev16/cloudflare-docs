:::note


If the `CNAME` target is on the same zone as the `CNAME` record, Cloudflare proceeds with `CNAME` flattening and ignores the **CNAME Flattening** setting.


:::

## For your zone apex

`CNAME` flattening occurs by default for all plans when your domain uses a `CNAME` record for its zone apex (`example.com`, meaning the record **Name** is set to `@`).

## For all CNAME records

For zones on paid plans, you can choose to flatten all `CNAME` records. This option is useful for <GlossaryTooltip term="proxy status">DNS-only (unproxied)</GlossaryTooltip> `CNAME` records. [Proxied records](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/#proxied-records) are flattened by default as they return Cloudflare anycast IPs.

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **DNS** > **Settings**.
3. Turn on the option **CNAME flattening for all CNAME records**.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

Make a `PATCH` request to the [Update DNS Settings](/api/operations/dns-settings-for-a-zone-update-dns-settings) endpoint and set `flatten_all_cnames` to `true` in the request body.

## Per record

Paid zones also have the option of flattening specific `CNAME` records.

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) and select your account and domain.
2. In **DNS** > **Settings**, make sure that **CNAME flattening for all CNAME records** is turned off.
3. Go to **DNS** > **Records** and find the `CNAME` record you would like to flatten.
4. Select **Edit** and turn on the **Flatten** option.
5. Select **Save** to confirm.

:::note[Unavailable flatten option]
For the following cases, **Flatten** will not be available:
- The record is at the [zone apex](#for-your-zone-apex).
- The record is already proxied, which means it will be flattened by default.
- **CNAME flattening for all CNAME records** is turned on, which means you cannot override it per record.

With the available [API endpoints](/api/operations/dns-records-for-a-zone-create-dns-record), specify the following for each `CNAME` record in the request body:

```txt
"settings": {
  "flatten_cname": true
}
```
