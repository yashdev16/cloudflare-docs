    title: Shard Cache by cache key
    description: |-
      For custom cache keys, enterprise customers can now shard their cache using up to three values for previously restricted headers `accept*`, `referer`, and `user-agent`. Sharding the cache can improve cache `HIT` ratio and performance. However, overly sharding your cache, can have the opposite effect.

    title: Generic tiered cache
    description: |-
      [Generic Global Tiered Cache](/cache/how-to/tiered-cache/#generic-global-tiered-cache) topology leverages all Cloudflare data centers as upper-tier cache network. It now hashes content within a region reducing duplication in upper-tier caches, which increases cache `HIT` ratio.
