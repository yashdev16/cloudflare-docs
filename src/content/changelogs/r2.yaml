  - publish_date: "2022-08-17"
    description: |-
      - The S3 `DeleteObjects` operation no longer trims the space from around the keys before deleting. This would result in files with leading / trailing spaces not being able to be deleted. Additionally, if there was an object with the trimmed key that existed it would be deleted instead. The S3 `DeleteObject` operation was not affected by this.
      - Fixed presigned URL support for the S3 `ListBuckets` and `ListObjects` operations.
  - publish_date: "2022-08-06"
    description: |-
      - Uploads will automatically infer the `Content-Type` based on file body

        the response that a basic AWS S3 bucket will return when first created: `GetBucketAcl`.
  - publish_date: "2022-07-20"
    description: |-
      - Added dummy implementations of the following operations that mimic the response that a basic AWS S3 bucket will return when first created:

        - `GetBucketVersioning`
        - `GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration`
        - `GetBucketReplication`
        - `GetBucketTagging`
        - `GetObjectLockConfiguration`
  - publish_date: "2022-07-19"
    description: |-
      - Fixed an S3 compatibility issue for error responses with MinIO .NET SDK and any other tooling that expects no `xmlns` namespace attribute on the top-level `Error` tag.
      - List continuation tokens prior to 2022-07-01 are no longer accepted and must be obtained again through a new `list` operation.
      - The `list()` binding will now correctly return a smaller limit if too much data would otherwise be returned (previously would return an `Internal Error`).
  - publish_date: "2022-07-14"
    description: |-
      - Improvements to 500s: we now convert errors, so things that were previously concurrency problems for some operations should now be `TooMuchConcurrency` instead of `InternalError`. We've also reduced the rate of 500s through internal improvements.
      - `ListMultipartUpload` correctly encodes the returned `Key` if the `encoding-type` is specified.
  - publish_date: "2022-07-13"
    description: |-
      - S3 XML documents sent to R2 that have an XML declaration are not rejected with `400 Bad Request` / `MalformedXML`.

      - Beta `ListMultipartUploads` support.
  - publish_date: "2022-07-06"
    description: |-
      - Support the `r2_list_honor_include` compat flag coming up in an upcoming runtime release (default behavior as of 2022-07-14 compat date). Without that compat flag/date, list will continue to function implicitly as `include: ['httpMetadata', 'customMetadata']` regardless of what you specify.
      - `cf-create-bucket-if-missing` can be set on a `PutObject`/`CreateMultipartUpload` request to implicitly create the bucket if it does not exist.
      - Fix S3 compatibility with MinIO client spec non-compliant XML for publishing multipart uploads. Any leading and trailing quotes in `CompleteMultipartUpload` are now optional and ignored as it seems to be the actual non-standard behavior AWS implements.
  - publish_date: "2022-07-01"
    description: |-
      - Unsupported search parameters to `ListObjects`/`ListObjectsV2` are
      now rejected with `501 Not Implemented`.
      - Fixes for Listing:
        - Fix listing behavior when the number of files within a folder exceeds the limit (you'd end
      up seeing a CommonPrefix for that large folder N times where N = number of children
      within the CommonPrefix / limit).
        - Fix corner case where listing could cause
      objects with sharing the base name of a \"folder\" to be skipped.
        - Fix listing over some files that shared a certain common prefix.
      - `DeleteObjects` can now handle 1000 objects at a time.
      - S3 `CreateBucket` request can specify `x-amz-bucket-object-lock-enabled` with a value of `false` and not have the requested rejected with a `NotImplemented`
        error. A value of `true` will continue to be rejected as R2 does not yet support
        object locks.
  - publish_date: "2022-06-17"
    description: |-
      - Fixed a regression for some clients when using an empty delimiter.

    description: |-
      - Fixed a bug where the S3 API's `PutObject` or the `.put()` binding could fail but still show the bucket upload as successful.
      - If [conditional headers](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7232) are provided to S3 API `UploadObject` or `CreateMultipartUpload` operations, and the object exists, a `412 Precondition Failed` status code will be returned if these checks are not met.
  - publish_date: "2022-05-20"
    description: |-
      - Fixed a bug when `Accept-Encoding` was being used in `SignedHeaders`
        when sending requests to the S3 API would result in a `SignatureDoesNotMatch`
        response.
  - publish_date: "2022-05-17"
    description: |-
      - Fixed a bug where requests to the S3 API were not handling non-encoded parameters used for the authorization signature.
      - Fixed a bug where requests to the S3 API where number-like keys were being parsed as numbers instead of strings.
  - publish_date: "2022-05-16"
    description: |-
      - Add support for S3 [virtual-hosted style paths](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/VirtualHosting.html), such as `<BUCKET>.<ACCOUNT_ID>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com` instead of path-based routing (`<ACCOUNT_ID>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/<BUCKET>`).

  - publish_date: "2022-05-06"
    description: |-
      - S3 API `GetObject` ranges are now inclusive (`bytes=0-0` will correctly return the first byte).
      - S3 API `GetObject` partial reads return the proper `206 Partial Content` response code.
      - Copying from a non-existent key (or from a non-existent bucket) to another bucket now returns the proper `NoSuchKey` / `NoSuchBucket` response.
      - The S3 API now returns the proper `Content-Type: application/xml` response header on relevant endpoints.
      - Multipart uploads now have a `-N` suffix on the etag representing the number of parts the file was published with.
      - `UploadPart` and `UploadPartCopy` now return proper error messages, such as `TooMuchConcurrency` or `NoSuchUpload`, instead of 'internal error'.
      - `UploadPart` can now be sent a 0-length part.
  - publish_date: "2022-05-05"
    description: |-
      - When using the S3 API, an empty string and `us-east-1` will now alias to the `auto` region for compatibility with external tools.
      - `GetBucketEncryption`, `PutBucketEncryption` and `DeleteBucketEncrypotion` are now supported (the only supported value currently is `AES256`).
      - Unsupported operations are explicitly rejected as unimplemented rather than implicitly converting them into `ListObjectsV2`/`PutBucket`/`DeleteBucket` respectively.
      - S3 API `CompleteMultipartUploads` requests are now properly escaped.
  - publish_date: "2022-05-03"
    description: |-
      - Pagination cursors are no longer returned when the keys in a bucket is the same as the `MaxKeys` argument.
      - The S3 API `ListBuckets` operation now accepts `cf-max-keys`, `cf-start-after` and `cf-continuation-token` headers behave the same as the respective URL parameters.
      - The S3 API `ListBuckets` and `ListObjects` endpoints now allow `per_page` to be 0.
      - The S3 API `CopyObject` source parameter now requires a leading slash.
      - The S3 API `CopyObject` operation now returns a `NoSuchBucket` error when copying to a non-existent bucket instead of an internal error.
