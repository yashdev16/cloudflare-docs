While user tokens act on behalf of a particular user and inherit a subset of that user's permissions, account owned tokens allow you to set up durable integrations that can act as service principals with their own specific set of permissions. This approach is ideal for scenarios like CI/CD, or building integrations with external services like SEIMs where it is important that the integration continues working, even long after the user who configured the integration may have left your organization altogether. User tokens are better for ad hoc tasks like scripting, where acting as the user is ideal and durability is less of a concern. 

## Create an account owned token
:::note
Creating an account owned token requires Super Administrator permission on the account
:::

1. Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com).
2. Go to **Manage Account** >  **Account API Tokens**.
4. Select **Create Token** and fill in the token name, permissions, and the optional expiration date for the token. 
5. Select **Continue to summary** and review the details.

Alternatively, you can create a token using the [account owned token creation API](/api/resources/accounts/subresources/tokens/methods/create/).
