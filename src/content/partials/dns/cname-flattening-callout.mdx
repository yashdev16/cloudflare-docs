If a `CNAME` target is being used to verify a domain for a third-party service, turning on [CNAME flattening for all CNAME records](/dns/cname-flattening/set-up-cname-flattening/#for-all-cname-records) may cause the verification to fail since the `CNAME` record itself will not be returned directly.
